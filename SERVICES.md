## Training Load Algorithm (ExerciseLoadService.swift)

**Purpose:** Daily training load score (0–100) reflecting accumulated training stress. Answers: "Should I train today, and how hard?" Drives the Training Load widget (Home) and Training Load Trend chart (Progress). Updates daily — including rest days — because stress decays over time.

`targetWorkoutsPerWeek` is NOT an input to this algorithm. It is used exclusively by Streak.

### Lookback Window
All workouts within the **last 10 days**. Anything older is ignored.

### Inputs — Per Workout (within 10-day window)

| Input | Source | Nil Handling |
|---|---|---|
| RPE | `workout.rpe` | Nil → assume **5** |
| Duration | `workout.durationMinutes` | Nil → use `targetMinutesPerWorkout` from UserSettings |
| Workout Type | `workout.workoutType` | Required (never nil) |
| Exercise Sets | `workout.exerciseSets` | Empty → volume modifier defaults to 1.0 |
| Date | `workout.date` | Required (never nil) |

### Inputs — Global

| Input | Source |
|---|---|
| Experience Level | `UserSettings.experienceLevel` |
| Target Minutes/Workout | `UserSettings.targetMinutesPerWorkout` (nil-duration fallback only) |

### Pre-Filter — Empty Workout Exclusion
Before processing, discard any workout in the 10-day window where **all three** conditions are true:
1. `exerciseSets` is empty (zero exercises)
2. `rpe` is nil
3. `durationMinutes` is nil

These workouts contain no meaningful training data (placeholder/shell entries) and must be excluded from the entire algorithm: they do not contribute to `session_stress` (Steps 1–5), do not count toward `consecutive_days` (Step 6), and do not factor into `today_stress` (Step 9).

A workout that has zero exercises but provides RPE and/or duration (e.g., a Yoga session with RPE 7, 45 min) passes the filter and is processed normally — the nil-handling defaults in the Inputs table above still apply.

**Scope:** This exclusion applies only to Training Load. Streak, Power Level, Weekly Workouts goal, and all other algorithms count these workouts normally.

### Step 1 — Workout Type Modifier
See `CONSTANTS.md` for modifier values per type. These are defined in AppConstants.

### Step 2 — Volume Modifier
For **Strength Training and HIIT** with ExerciseSets:
```
total_sets = sum of `sets` across all ExerciseSets
volume_modifier = clamp(0.5 + (total_sets / 20), min: 0.5, max: 1.5)
```
0 sets → 0.5, 10 sets → 1.0, 20+ sets → 1.5. Uses set count (not tonnage) because bodyweight exercises have nil weight.

For **all other types** (no ExerciseSets): `volume_modifier = 1.0`.

### Step 3 — Per-Session Stress
```
session_stress = RPE × (duration_minutes / 60) × type_modifier × volume_modifier
```
Duration divided by 60 normalizes to hours. Typical session (RPE 7, 60 min, Strength, 10 sets) = 7.0.

### Step 4 — Experience-Based Decay Constant (τ)

| Experience Level | τ (days) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Beginner (0) | 3.0 | Stress lingers longest. ~37% remains after 3 days. |
| Intermediate (1) | 2.0 | ~37% remains after 2 days. |
| Advanced (2) | 1.5 | Fastest recovery. ~37% remains after 1.5 days. |

### Step 5 — Time-Decayed Contribution
```
days_ago = (now - workout.date) in fractional days
decayed_stress = session_stress × e^(-days_ago / τ)
```
Uses fractional days — a workout 8 hours ago contributes more than one 20 hours ago.

### Step 6 — Consecutive Training Days Multiplier
Count consecutive calendar days (each with ≥1 qualifying workout — see Pre-Filter above), ending on today or yesterday. If most recent workout was 2+ days ago, `consecutive_days = 0`.
```
consecutive_multiplier = 1.0 + max(consecutive_days - 1, 0) × 0.08
```
Capped at 5+ days:

| Consecutive Days | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| 0 or 1 | 1.00 |
| 2 | 1.08 |
| 3 | 1.16 |
| 4 | 1.24 |
| 5+ | 1.32 (cap) |

### Step 7 — Stress Capacity (Normalization)

| Experience Level | Stress Capacity |
|---|---|
| Beginner (0) | 15 |
| Intermediate (1) | 20 |
| Advanced (2) | 25 |

### Step 8 — Final Score
```
raw_stress = sum of decayed_stress for all workouts in the 10-day window
adjusted_stress = raw_stress × consecutive_multiplier
load_score = clamp((adjusted_stress / stress_capacity) × 100, min: 0, max: 100)
```

### Step 9 — Same-Day Training Floor
Prevents the score from advising "train hard" on a day the user already trained. Only qualifying workouts count (see Pre-Filter above).
```
today_stress = sum of session_stress for all workouts on today's calendar date
               (raw values — no decay, since they are from today)
floor = clamp((today_stress / stress_capacity) × 150, min: 0, max: 80)
load_score = max(load_score, floor)
```
The `× 150` multiplier makes today's sessions count 1.5× for floor purposes. Cap at 80 prevents floor alone from reaching Peak. Floor lifts automatically next day (today_stress = 0 → floor = 0).

### Step 10 — Zone Classification
See `CONSTANTS.md` for zone ranges, colors, and advisory text tables.

### Settings Change Behavior
Always uses current `experienceLevel` at calculation time. Changing experience recalculates immediately using new τ and stress capacity for all workouts in the 10-day window. No per-workout versioning.

## Streak Algorithm (StreakService.swift)

**Purpose:** Consecutive-week workout streak driving the streak widget on Home.

**Completed week:** Monday 00:00:00 through Sunday 23:59:59. Completed when workout count in that range ≥ `targetWorkoutsPerWeek`.

**Calculation** (on app launch, after each workout save/edit/delete, and after Settings changes):

1. Start from the most recently completed week (last full Mon–Sun that ended). Walk backward.
2. For each week, count workouts where `workout.date` falls within Mon–Sun.
3. If count ≥ target → counts toward streak; continue to prior week.
4. If count < target → stop. Streak = number of consecutive completed weeks.
5. If current in-progress week already has count ≥ target → add 1 (provisional extension).
6. If `targetWorkoutsPerWeek` is 0 → streak always 0 (dormant state).
7. Update `currentStreak`. If > `longestStreak`, update `longestStreak`.

**Settings change:** Changing target recalculates retroactively for all historical weeks.

**Flame tiers and motivational messages:** See `CONSTANTS.md`.

---

## Power Level Algorithm (PowerLevelService.swift)

**Purpose:** Status (Deloading/Steady/Rising) reflecting average strength volume trend over 30 days vs. prior 30-day baseline. Answers: "Is my training volume trending up, down, or steady?"

**Scope:** Only **Strength Training** and **HIIT** workouts. All others excluded.

### Volume Formula — Per Workout
```
workout_volume = sum of (sets × reps × effective_weight) across all ExerciseSets
```
If `weightKg` is nil (bodyweight): `effective_weight = 1.0`.

### Time Windows

| Window | Range |
|---|---|
| Current period | Today − 30 days through today |
| Baseline period | Today − 60 days through today − 31 days |

Both windows use calendar days, inclusive.

### Step 1 — Current Average
```
current_avg = sum of workout_volume / count of qualifying workouts in current period
```
Empty → `current_avg = 0`.

### Step 2 — Baseline Average
```
baseline_avg = sum of workout_volume / count of qualifying workouts in baseline period
```
Empty → `baseline_avg = 0`.

### Step 3 — Percentage Change
```
If baseline_avg = 0: status = Steady
Else: pct_change = ((current_avg - baseline_avg) / baseline_avg) × 100
```

### Step 4 — Status Classification

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| No baseline data (baseline_avg = 0) | Steady |
| No current data (current_avg = 0, baseline > 0) | Deloading |
| pct_change < −10% | Deloading |
| −10% ≤ pct_change ≤ +10% | Steady |
| pct_change > +10% | Rising |

**Contextual messages and indicators:** See `CONSTANTS.md`.

**Edge cases:** < 31 days history → baseline empty → Steady. Zero qualifying workouts in both → "No data" message. Recalculates on workout log/edit/delete.

**No dependency on UserSettings.** Purely data-driven.

## Goal Auto-Update (GoalService.swift)

### Reset Scoping (applies to all auto-updated goal types)
All auto-update scans (Strength PR, Repetitions PR, Speed and Distance) filter workouts against each goal's `resetDate`. A workout is **in-scope** for a goal if any of the following is true:
- `goal.resetDate` is nil (goal has never been reset, or was cleared by editing the goal definition), OR
- `workout.date > goal.resetDate`, OR
- `workout.lastModifiedDate > goal.resetDate` (workout was created or edited after the reset, regardless of its `date` — includes cosmetic edits).

Workouts that are out-of-scope are invisible to the goal's auto-update and to GoalSnapshotService until either the goal is edited (clearing `resetDate`) or the workout is modified (refreshing `lastModifiedDate`). The `lastModifiedDate` bump applies uniformly to ALL workout edits, including cosmetic changes (name, notes, time) — there is no allowlist of "meaningful" fields.

This scoping applies to Weekly Workouts as well in principle, but in practice Weekly Workouts has no "Reset Goal Progress" action (its current value is runtime-derived) so `resetDate` is always nil for that type.

### Strength PR Goals
After each workout save: scan **in-scope** workouts (per § Reset Scoping). For all Strength PR goals, compare title (case-insensitive) against exerciseNames in the in-scope workouts' ExerciseSets. `currentValueKg` is set to the **highest matching weightKg across all in-scope workouts** (best-ever within scope) — not incrementally compared against the prior value. This ensures the ring correctly reflects the current best after edits, deletions, and resets.

On workout deletion: recalculate currentValueKg by scanning all remaining in-scope workouts for highest matching weightKg. No in-scope matches → reset to 0.

Custom-titled goals not matching any exerciseName are never auto-updated.

### Repetitions PR Goals
Same matching logic as Strength PR, but compares `reps` instead of weightKg. `currentReps` is set to the **highest matching reps across all in-scope workouts**. On deletion, recalculates from remaining in-scope data; resets to 0 if no matches.

### Speed and Distance Goals
Auto-updated by matching on **workout type** (e.g., all "Cardio" workouts update linked Speed and Distance goals), scoped to in-scope workouts only (per § Reset Scoping).

Auto-update rule by sub-type (best-ever within scope):
- **Distance-only:** `currentDistanceKm` = highest `distanceKm` across all in-scope matching workouts. No in-scope matches → 0.
- **Duration-only (endurance):** `currentDurationMinutes` = highest `durationMinutes` across all in-scope matching workouts (higher is better per § Goal Progress Calculation). No in-scope matches → 0.
- **Speed-target (both distance and duration set):** Compute each in-scope matching workout's `overallProgress %` using the existing speed target logic (§ Goal Progress Calculation). Select the workout with the highest `overallProgress %` and copy its `distanceKm` → `currentDistanceKm` and `durationMinutes` → `currentDurationMinutes` (take the full workout, never a composite across separate runs). Ties broken by most recent `date`. No in-scope matches → both current values = 0.

On workout deletion or edit affecting matching workouts: recalculate per the rule above across remaining in-scope matching workouts.

### Number of Weekly Workouts Goals
This goal type is a visual tracker that reads its target from `UserSettings.targetWorkoutsPerWeek` and computes its current value at runtime. It does not store target or current values on the Goal model — both are derived:
- **Target:** Read from `UserSettings.targetWorkoutsPerWeek` at display time. If the user changes the target in Settings, the goal card reflects the new target immediately.
- **Current value:** Count of all workouts where `workout.date` falls within the current Monday 00:00:00 – Sunday 23:59:59 week. Uses the same week definition as the Streak algorithm.
- **Progress:** current / target × 100. If target is 0, progress is 0%.
- **Victory:** Achieved when current ≥ target (and target > 0). Resets each Monday when the new week begins.
- **Auto-update:** Recalculates after each workout save, edit, or delete (same triggers as Streak).
- **Singleton:** Only one weeklyWorkouts goal can exist at a time. GoalService enforces this on creation.
- **Deletion:** Deletable like any other goal via the long-press context menu. Deleting it does not affect `targetWorkoutsPerWeek` in Settings or the Streak algorithm.

### Goal Progress Calculation
- **exercisePR:** currentValueKg / targetValueKg × 100
- **repsPR:** currentReps / targetReps × 100
- **speedDistance (distance only):** currentDistanceKm / targetDistanceKm × 100
- **speedDistance (duration only, endurance):** currentDurationMinutes / targetDurationMinutes × 100 (higher = better — "higher is better" endurance semantics)
- **speedDistance (both — speed target):** A speed target means "complete the distance in at or below the duration." Logic:
  - `distanceProgress = clamp((currentDistanceKm / targetDistanceKm) × 100, 0, 100)`
  - `durationProgress`:
    - If `currentDurationMinutes <= targetDurationMinutes` (at or under target time): `durationProgress = 100` (user met or beat the time goal)
    - If `currentDurationMinutes > targetDurationMinutes` (over target time — running too slow): `durationProgress = clamp((targetDurationMinutes / currentDurationMinutes) × 100, 0, 100)`
  - `overallProgress = min(distanceProgress, durationProgress)` — overall progress percentage (used for ring display, sparkline value, and completion check).
  - **Completion:** `currentDistanceKm >= targetDistanceKm` AND `currentDurationMinutes <= targetDurationMinutes`. Beating the target time (running faster than required) still counts as completion.
  - **Example:** Goal is 5 miles in 30 minutes. User runs 5 miles in 20 minutes → distance = 100%, duration = 100% (clamped — user beat the time), overall = 100%, goal completes. User runs 5 miles in 45 minutes → distance = 100%, duration ≈ 67% (30/45), overall = 67%, goal does not complete.

**Note:** The speed target logic (above) applies ONLY when both distance and duration targets are set. Duration-only (endurance) goals continue to use the original "higher is better" logic unchanged.

### Goal Completion Date Tracking
After every goal auto-update, GoalService checks if any goal has crossed 100%. If so:
1. Check `goal.lastCelebratedDate`. If `lastCelebratedDate` is nil or the current date is strictly after `lastCelebratedDate`, proceed; otherwise skip.
2. Set `goal.lastCelebratedDate` to the current date.

This drives the "COMPLETED [date]" micro-label and the Completion Pulse Animation on the Goals screen (see `SCREENS.md` § Goals).

**Re-completion edge case:** If a workout edit causes a goal to drop below 100% and it later crosses 100% again, `lastCelebratedDate` only updates if the new completion date is strictly after the existing value (per step 1 above).

**Trigger paths:** The setter fires from all workout-save cascades — direct workout logging, Plan tab completion (PlanService), and Today's Plan HomeWidget completion. All paths call the same GoalService auto-update logic.

### Reset Goal Progress
Called from the long-press context menu "Reset Goal Progress" option on individual goal cards.
- **exercisePR:** Set `currentValueKg` to 0.
- **repsPR:** Set `currentReps` to 0.
- **speedDistance:** Set `currentDistanceKm` to 0 and `currentDurationMinutes` to 0.
- **weeklyWorkouts:** Not applicable — this goal type derives its current value at runtime. The "Reset Goal Progress" option is hidden for this goal type.
- Set `resetDate` to `.now`. All existing workouts are now out-of-scope for this goal (per § Reset Scoping) until they are edited (refreshing `lastModifiedDate`) or new workouts are logged.
- Clear `lastCelebratedDate` to nil (removes the "COMPLETED [date]" label and allows the Completion Pulse to re-fire if the goal is achieved again).
- **Wipe GoalSnapshot history:** Delete all GoalSnapshot records for this goal via `GoalSnapshotService.deleteSnapshots(goalId:)`. The sparkline restarts from scratch — it will show the brand-new skeleton state until new in-scope workouts generate snapshots. Do NOT append a zero-valued snapshot.

**Clearing `resetDate`:** `resetDate` is cleared to nil when the user edits the goal definition via the Add/Edit Goal flow (e.g., changing target weight, target distance, exercise name). Editing the goal is treated as a deliberate re-baselining action — pre-reset workouts come back into scope. `resetDate` is not cleared by any other path; workout edits alone do not clear it (they just bump `lastModifiedDate` on the workout, which re-scopes that specific workout).

---

## Deletion Cascading Behavior

### Workout Cascade (shared definition)

Any time a workout is logged, edited, deleted, or batch-deleted via workout type deletion, the following cascade runs against the resulting workout set. HealthKit import (auto-create or link — see HEALTHKIT.md § 10, § 12) and HealthKit upstream update (see § HealthKit Upstream Update below) route through the same cascade entry points (`WorkoutService.log()` and `WorkoutService.update()` respectively) — there is no separate HealthKit cascade. Individual cascade sections below reference this block rather than restating it.

**Recalculations:**
- **PR timeline** — remove PRs without supporting data; recompute from remaining workout data.
- **Training Load score** — remove affected workouts from the 10-day window; `consecutive_days` may change.
- **Home screen** — Workout Info widget, Recent Workouts list, Training Load widget refresh.
- **Strength Tracker chart** — data points reflect current state.
- **Training Frequency chart** — affected week(s) re-count.
- **Strength PR goals** — recalculate `currentValueKg` for matching goals across remaining in-scope workouts (per § Reset Scoping). No in-scope matches → 0.
- **Repetitions PR goals** — recalculate `currentReps` for matching goals across remaining in-scope workouts. No in-scope matches → 0.
- **Speed and Distance goals** — recalculate `currentDistanceKm` and `currentDurationMinutes` per § Speed and Distance Goals (best-ever within scope) across remaining in-scope matching-type workouts. No in-scope matches → both current values = 0.
- **GoalSnapshot records** — for each affected goal, recompute snapshots on the affected date(s) per § GoalSnapshotService § Per-Workout Value Computation. If no remaining in-scope matching workouts exist on a given date, delete that goal's snapshot for that date.
- **Weekly streak** — recalculate across affected weeks.
- **Power Level** — recalculate if Strength Training or HIIT was involved.
- **Workout Type card** — update count. If the last workout of a type is gone, remove the card and delete the WorkoutTypeOrder record (see § Workout Type Deletion for the batch case).
- **Scheduled workout linkage** — if a deleted workout's ID matches any `ScheduledWorkout.completedWorkoutId`, set that field to nil and revert status to "planned".

### Workout Deletion
Apply the Workout Cascade to remaining data.

### Workout Edit
Apply the Workout Cascade to updated data. Additionally, **every workout edit sets `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now`** regardless of which fields changed (including cosmetic edits to name, notes, or time). This refreshes the workout's scope against any goal `resetDate` per § Reset Scoping.

Edit-specific notes:
- **Date changed** — the cascade runs against both the old and new `workout.date` (Training Frequency hits both weeks; GoalSnapshot recomputes both the old-date and new-date snapshots).
- **Cosmetic-only change** (name/notes/time with no value-affecting fields) — `lastModifiedDate` still bumps, which re-scopes the workout against any goal `resetDate` and triggers full goal auto-update and snapshot recalc. No Training Load / chart recalc beyond this.

### Workout Type Deletion
When a workout type is deleted via the context menu, ALL workouts of that type are deleted in a single batch operation. Apply the Workout Cascade as a batch across every deleted workout, plus:
- All ExerciseSets across all deleted workouts are cascade-deleted from SwiftData.
- The WorkoutTypeOrder record for the deleted type is removed; the Workout Type card disappears from the Workouts screen.
- Remaining WorkoutTypeOrder records do NOT re-index `sortOrder` — the gap is acceptable; relative order preserved.
- Any linked ScheduledWorkout slots revert to "planned" (via the Workout Cascade's Scheduled workout linkage rule).

### Goal Deletion
Remove goal from SwiftData. Cascade-delete all associated GoalSnapshot records (matching goalId). Re-index remaining goals' sortOrder.

### Template Deletion
Remove WorkoutTemplate + all TemplateExerciseSets (cascade). No effect on any other data.

### Widget Deletion
Remove HomeWidget record only. No underlying data affected. Widget re-addable via Add Widget menu. Remaining widgets re-index sortOrder.

### Chart Deletion
Remove TrendsChart record only. No underlying data affected. Chart re-addable via Add Charts menu. Remaining charts re-index sortOrder. Identical behavior to Widget Deletion.

### Scheduled Workout Deletion
Remove `ScheduledWorkout` record. No effect on any other data (no Workout is created until completion). For recurring workouts, "Remove from Plan → This and future" removes this instance and all future instances sharing the same `recurrenceGroupId` — past completed/skipped instances are preserved.

**Completed scheduled workout removed via Plan ("Remove from Plan" dual-action):** The `ScheduledWorkout` record is deleted AND the linked `Workout` has `hiddenFromPlan` set to `true`. See SERVICES.md § PlanService → Remove from Plan for full semantics. The underlying `Workout` is otherwise unaffected — all cascades (PR, Training Load, streaks, goals, charts) continue to include it.

### Workout Hide from Plan (hiddenFromPlan flag)
`hiddenFromPlan` is a pure display flag on the `Workout` model. Setting or clearing it **does not trigger any cascade** — PR timelines, Training Load, streaks, Power Level, goals, GoalSnapshot records, and all charts are unaffected. The flag exclusively controls whether the `Workout` surfaces on the Plan screen (see SERVICES.md § PlanService → Retrieval → Fetch Plan surface). No cascade recalculations are needed when the flag changes.

### HealthKit Auto-Create / Link
When `WorkoutMatcher` returns a high-confidence match (auto-link) or when no match exists and `HealthKitSyncService` creates a new `Workout` from an HK import (auto-create), the Workout Cascade fires via `WorkoutService.log()`. See HEALTHKIT.md § 10, § 12. No HK-specific cascade rules beyond the shared definition — all algorithms recalculate exactly as they would for any manually logged workout.

### HealthKit Upstream Update
When `HealthKitSyncService` detects that an HK-linked workout's HK-owned fields have changed upstream (e.g., user edited duration in Apple's Health app), apply the changes via `WorkoutService.update()`. HK wins on HK-owned fields (see HEALTHKIT.md § 7 for ownership rules): `date`, `durationMinutes`, `distanceKm`, `avgHeartRate`, `maxHeartRate`, `activeEnergyKcal`, `totalEnergyBurnedKcal`, `elevationAscendedMeters`, `exerciseMinutes`, `indoor`, `healthKitActivityType`. User-owned fields (`name`, `note`, `time`, `ExerciseSets`, `rpe`) are not touched.

`lastModifiedDate` bumps to `.now`. Full Workout Cascade fires against the updated record. Edit-specific rules from § Workout Edit apply — in particular, if `date` changed, the cascade runs against both the old and new `workout.date`.

### HealthKit Upstream Delete
When `HealthKitSyncService` receives a `deletedObjectHandler` callback for an HK workout matching an existing FortiFit `Workout.healthKitUUID`:

1. Clear `healthKitUUID`, `healthKitSourceBundleID`, and `healthKitActivityType` to nil.
2. Retain all HK-sourced numeric values (duration, distance, HR, calories, elevation, exercise minutes, indoor flag) as-is — they become regular editable fields on a now-manual workout.
3. Bump `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now`. This re-scopes the workout against any goal `resetDate` (see § Reset Scoping).
4. **Do NOT fire the deletion cascade.** This is not a deletion — the workout is being promoted to manual.

See HEALTHKIT.md § 11 for rationale. This is a non-destructive operation: the user retains their training history even if they clean up HealthKit data upstream.

### HealthKit Unlink (user-initiated)
Identical to HealthKit Upstream Delete in data behavior (clear the three pointer fields, retain numeric values, bump `lastModifiedDate`, no cascade), but triggered by the user via Workout Detail's ellipsis menu, the source indicator info sheet, or the Log Workout disabled-field helper text. See HEALTHKIT.md § 14. Re-adds the HK workout UUID to `WorkoutMatcher`'s candidate pool for future sync events.

---

## WorkoutService (WorkoutService.swift)

CRUD wrapper for workouts via SwiftData:
- **Log:** Create workout + ExerciseSets. Set `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now`. Trigger PR recalculation and goal auto-update. **Dual entry point:** also called by `HealthKitSyncService` on HK import (auto-create path, after `WorkoutMatcher` returns no match) and by `WorkoutMatcher` on auto-link (applies HK-owned field values from the HK record to an existing manual workout). On the manual-log path, call `WorkoutMatcher.findMatch(forNewManualWorkout:)` immediately after save — if a high-confidence match exists, auto-link; if a lower-confidence match exists, queue for prompt; otherwise proceed normally. See HEALTHKIT.md § 11, § 12.
- **Retrieve:** Sorted by date (newest first).
- **Update:** Full workout (name, date, time, RPE, duration, distance, add/modify/delete ExerciseSets). Set `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now` on every update regardless of which fields changed (including cosmetic edits — see § Workout Edit cascade). Trigger PR recalc and goal auto-update. **HK-linked workouts:** when `workout.healthKitUUID != nil`, `durationMinutes`, `distanceKm`, and `date` are read-only at the UI layer (see SCREENS.md § Log Workout). Update must still tolerate these values being non-nil (they are populated by HK sync, not the user). HK upstream updates flow through this same method — see § HealthKit Upstream Update.
- **Update notes:** Inline note edit. Sets `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now` (cosmetic edit per § Reset Scoping).
- **Delete:** Cascade-delete all ExerciseSets. Trigger all cascading recalculations (see Deletion Behavior above). If the deleted workout is linked to a `ScheduledWorkout` (via `completedWorkoutId`), notify PlanService to revert that slot to "planned". **HK-linked workouts delete normally** — deletion removes the FortiFit record but does not propagate to HealthKit (no write-back in MVP). Orphan `WorkoutMatchRejection` records pointing at the deleted workout are retained; harmless.
- **Delete all for type:** Accept a workoutType string, fetch all workouts matching that type, cascade-delete each with ExerciseSets, then trigger all cascading recalculations once (see Workout Type Deletion above). Remove the corresponding WorkoutTypeOrder record. Revert any linked ScheduledWorkout slots to "planned".
- **Unlink (HK-linked workouts):** Invoked via Workout Detail's ellipsis menu, the source indicator info sheet, or the Log Workout disabled-field helper text. See § HealthKit Unlink for data behavior.

---

## HealthKitClient (HealthKitClient.swift)

**Purpose:** Protocol abstraction over Apple's HealthKit framework. All HealthKit access in FortiFit goes through this protocol. The concrete implementation (`DefaultHealthKitClient`) is the only file in the codebase that imports `HealthKit`. Integration tests inject `StubHealthKitClient` from `TestFixtures.swift` instead (see TESTING.md § HealthKit Test Strategy).

See HEALTHKIT.md § 4 for the architectural rationale.

### Protocol Surface

The protocol defines the following operations (exact Swift signatures to be finalized by Claude Code; shape documented here):

| Operation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `requestAuthorization() async throws` | Invoke Apple's authorization prompt with the read permission list. See HEALTHKIT.md § 17. |
| `authorizationStatus() → HealthKitAuthorizationStatus` | Returns one of: `.notDetermined`, `.granted`, `.denied`. Used by Settings to render the status line. |
| `fetchWorkouts(since anchor: HKQueryAnchor?) async throws → (workouts: [HKWorkoutSnapshot], deletedUUIDs: [UUID], newAnchor: HKQueryAnchor)` | Anchored query returning workouts added or modified since the anchor, plus a list of UUIDs for workouts deleted upstream. Drives catch-up-on-launch and live sync. |
| `observeWorkoutChanges(handler: @escaping () → Void)` | Register an `HKObserverQuery` with `enableBackgroundDelivery`. Handler fires (on a background thread) when HK has new or changed workout data. `HealthKitSyncService` hops to `@MainActor` before acting. |
| `fetchEffortScore(for hkWorkoutUUID: UUID) async throws → Int?` | Query the user-entered `workoutEffortScore` sample related to an HK workout. Returns nil if no user-entered score exists. Ignores `estimatedWorkoutEffortScore`. iOS 18+ only — gated `if #available(iOS 18, *)`. See HEALTHKIT.md § 8. |
| `sourceName(for bundleID: String) → String` | Resolves an `HKSource` bundle ID to a clean human-readable name. **Never returns a raw bundle ID.** Resolution rules: (1) Apple Watch source bundle → `"Apple Workout"` (rebrand from "Apple Watch"). (2) Other recognized sources → their `HKSource.name` value (e.g., `"Strava"`, `"Peloton"`). (3) Unrecognized / unresolvable bundle IDs → `"another app"` (graceful fallback). Used by the Workout Detail source indicator (inline format `{healthKitActivityType} · {sourceName} [glyph]`) and the Source Indicator Info Sheet body copy (`This workout was imported from Apple Health via {sourceName}.`). The caller never has to handle nil; the fallback string is always serviceable in either rendering surface. See SCREENS.md § Workout Detail → Source Indicator. |

### HealthKitWorkoutSnapshot

A plain Swift struct (not an `HKWorkout`) containing exactly the fields FortiFit cares about. Returned by `fetchWorkouts`. Keeps the protocol boundary free of Apple framework types so the stub and tests don't need to construct real `HKWorkout` instances.

Fields: `uuid`, `activityTypeRawValue`, `activityTypeDisplayString`, `sourceBundleID`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `durationMinutes`, `distanceKm?`, `avgHeartRate?`, `maxHeartRate?`, `activeEnergyKcal?`, `totalEnergyBurnedKcal?`, `elevationAscendedMeters?`, `exerciseMinutes?`, `indoor?`, `isDeleted` (flag indicating this entry represents an upstream delete rather than an addition/update).

### Rules

- **No other service imports `HealthKit`.** Only `DefaultHealthKitClient` does. Enforced by convention in code review and by TESTING.md § HealthKit Test Strategy.
- **Threading is the client's contract.** The protocol methods may be called from any actor. The concrete implementation marshals internal HK framework calls appropriately. Callers assume results are returned on the calling actor.
- **Authorization is fire-and-forget.** `requestAuthorization()` completes when the user responds to the iOS prompt. The client does not cache the result — callers re-query `authorizationStatus()` as needed.

### File Dependencies

| File | Location | Purpose |

## HealthKitSyncService (HealthKitSyncService.swift)

**Purpose:** Orchestrate the full HealthKit sync lifecycle — authorization, catch-up queries on launch, live observer queries, background refresh, upstream updates, upstream deletes, and manual "Sync Now" from Settings. Routes imports through `WorkoutMatcher` and ultimately through `WorkoutService.log()` / `update()` so the full Workout Cascade fires on every imported change.

See HEALTHKIT.md § 9 for the sync lifecycle overview.

### Responsibilities

- Own the `HKQueryAnchor` persisted in UserDefaults (`UserSettings.healthKitAnchor`).
- Register the `HKObserverQuery` with `enableBackgroundDelivery` on launch (Phase 2 only — see HEALTHKIT.md § 3 Phases).
- Register the `BGAppRefreshTask` handler on launch (Phase 2).
- Run a catch-up anchored query on every cold launch and foreground transition (Phase 1 — mandatory).
- On each sync event: fetch workouts since anchor, process each via `importPendingWorkouts()`, update anchor on success.
- Update `UserSettings.healthKitLastSyncDate` to `.now` after each successful sync.

### Triggers

| Source | Phase | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| App launch (cold) | 1 | Run catch-up anchored query. |
| App foreground transition | 1 | Run catch-up anchored query. |
| Manual "Sync Now" button in Settings | 1 | Run catch-up anchored query immediately. |
| `HKObserverQuery` fires | 2 | Run anchored query on background thread, marshal to `@MainActor` for SwiftData writes. |
| `BGAppRefreshTask` executes | 2 | Run anchored query; update anchor; complete task. |
| `UserSettings.healthKitEnabled` flipped off | 1 | Cancel any in-flight queries. Retain anchor (for re-enable). Existing linked workouts unchanged — see HEALTHKIT.md § 16. |
| `UserSettings.healthKitEnabled` flipped on (first time) | 1 | Call `client.requestAuthorization()`. On grant, run catch-up. On deny, update Settings status line. |

### Import Pipeline (`importPendingWorkouts()`)

For each `HealthKitWorkoutSnapshot` returned by the anchored query:

1. **If `snapshot.isDeleted == true` → Upstream Delete handler.** Find the FortiFit `Workout` with matching `healthKitUUID`. If found, apply § HealthKit Upstream Delete rules (null out pointer fields, bump `lastModifiedDate`, no cascade). If not found, no-op.
2. **Else if a FortiFit `Workout` exists with `healthKitUUID == snapshot.uuid` → Upstream Update handler.** Apply § HealthKit Upstream Update rules via `WorkoutService.update()`. HK wins on HK-owned fields; user-owned fields untouched. Full cascade fires.
3. **Else (new HK workout) → Matcher path.** Call `WorkoutMatcher.findMatch(forIncomingHKWorkout: snapshot)`. Three possible outcomes:
   - **High-confidence match:** matcher auto-links the snapshot to the existing FortiFit `Workout` (see WorkoutMatcher § Link Application below). No new `Workout` created.
   - **Lower-confidence match:** matcher queues the pairing for the Match Prompt Sheet. No new `Workout` created yet. Pairing waits for user decision.
   - **No match:** proceed to step 4.
4. **Auto-create.** If `snapshot.durationMinutes < 2`, skip entirely (minimum-duration floor — see HEALTHKIT.md § 9). Otherwise, build a new `Workout` with the default field values from HEALTHKIT.md § 10 and route through `WorkoutService.log()`. Full cascade fires.

After processing all snapshots, persist the new anchor to `UserSettings.healthKitAnchor` and update `healthKitLastSyncDate`.

### Effort Score Handling (iOS 18+)

After auto-create or link, if `rpe` is nil and the device is iOS 18+, call `client.fetchEffortScore(for: healthKitUUID)`. If a non-nil result is returned, set `workout.rpe = result`. Never overwrites a user-entered RPE (see HEALTHKIT.md § 8). Runs as part of the same cascade — subsequent Training Load, goal auto-update, and snapshot recalculations see the populated RPE.

### Threading

All `WorkoutService` and `ModelContext` calls execute on `@MainActor`. Observer query callbacks (background thread) marshal via `await MainActor.run { ... }` before any SwiftData write. Anchored query fetches may run on a background thread; only the import pipeline's write step is main-bound.

### Error Handling

- **Authorization denial:** no workouts imported. Settings status line shows "Permission denied in iOS Settings" with deep-link button.
- **Anchored query failure:** log to `BUGS.md` if recurring. Retry on next trigger. Anchor not updated on failure (next sync re-attempts from the last good anchor).
- **Individual snapshot processing failure:** log, skip that snapshot, continue processing remaining snapshots. Do not abort the full sync for a single bad record.

## WorkoutMatcher (WorkoutMatcher.swift)

**Purpose:** Bidirectional deduplication between HealthKit-imported workouts and manually logged FortiFit workouts. Determines whether an incoming workout should be auto-linked to an existing record, prompt the user for resolution, or proceed as a separate record.

See HEALTHKIT.md § 12 for the architectural overview.

### Entry Points

Single service, called from two places:

| Caller | Method | When |
|---|---|---|
| `HealthKitSyncService.importPendingWorkouts()` | `findMatch(forIncomingHKWorkout: HealthKitWorkoutSnapshot) → MatchResult` | Before auto-creating a new `Workout` from an HK import. |
| `WorkoutService.log()` | `findMatch(forNewManualWorkout: Workout) → MatchResult` | Immediately after saving a manual workout. |

Both methods apply the same matching rules. Differences:
- HK-side match returns candidate `Workout` IDs to link the incoming snapshot to.
- Manual-side match returns candidate `HealthKitWorkoutSnapshot`s (from the current HK candidate pool) to link the just-saved Workout to.

### MatchResult

Enum with three cases:

| Case | Meaning | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| `.highConfidence(matchedWorkoutId)` / `.highConfidence(matchedSnapshot)` | Overlapping time windows, same FortiFit type. | Caller auto-links immediately. |
| `.lowerConfidence(candidateId)` / `.lowerConfidence(candidateSnapshot)` | Same FortiFit type, same calendar day, non-overlapping, start times within 4 hours. | Caller queues a pending match for the Match Prompt Sheet. |
| `.noMatch` | Outside both windows, or different FortiFit type, or different calendar day. | Caller proceeds with auto-create or keeps the manual log as-is. |

### Matching Rules

**High-confidence (auto-link):**
- Same FortiFit `workoutType` (after HK-to-category mapping for the HK side — see CONSTANTS.md § HealthKit Mapping).
- `|startA − startB| ≤ 5 minutes` AND `|endA − endB| ≤ 5 minutes`.

**Lower-confidence (prompt):**
- Same FortiFit `workoutType`.
- Same calendar day.
- Time windows do NOT overlap (per the high-confidence rule above — if they overlap, it's high-confidence, not lower).
- `|startA − startB| ≤ 4 hours`.

**No match:**
- Any of the above conditions fail.
- Note: same-day same-type workouts MORE than 4 hours apart (typical AM+PM splits) are expected to be separate records. No prompt. See HEALTHKIT.md § 12.

### Rejection Check

Before returning `.highConfidence` or `.lowerConfidence`, query for an existing `WorkoutMatchRejection` with matching `(healthKitUUID, workoutId)`. If found, return `.noMatch` instead.

Rejection lookup is by UUID pair, not by `@Relationship`. Orphan rejections (created when a linked `Workout` is deleted) are harmless and retained — see PRD.md § Data Model (WorkoutMatchRejection).

### Link Application

When a caller receives `.highConfidence` and performs auto-link (or when the user taps "Link these workouts" in the Match Prompt Sheet), `WorkoutMatcher.applyLink(workout:snapshot:)` performs:

1. Set `workout.healthKitUUID = snapshot.uuid`.
2. Set `workout.healthKitSourceBundleID = snapshot.sourceBundleID`.
3. Set `workout.healthKitActivityType = snapshot.activityTypeDisplayString`.
4. Apply HK-owned field values from `snapshot`:
   - `workout.date = snapshot.startDate`
   - `workout.durationMinutes = snapshot.durationMinutes`
   - `workout.distanceKm = snapshot.distanceKm` (if snapshot has it)
   - `workout.avgHeartRate`, `workout.maxHeartRate`, `workout.activeEnergyKcal`, `workout.totalEnergyBurnedKcal`, `workout.elevationAscendedMeters`, `workout.exerciseMinutes`, `workout.indoor` — all copied from snapshot.
5. User-owned fields (`name`, `note`, `time`, `ExerciseSets`, `rpe`) are NOT touched.
6. Bump `workout.lastModifiedDate = .now`.
7. Fire Workout Cascade via `WorkoutService.update()` (measured-field changes may affect Training Load, goals, snapshots).

On iOS 18+, after link, run the effort-score nil-fill step (see HealthKitSyncService § Effort Score Handling).

### Prompt Queue

Lower-confidence matches are queued via `WorkoutMatcher.queuePendingMatch(workoutId:snapshot:)`. The queue is a simple in-memory list (non-persistent — acceptable because pending matches re-surface on next sync if unresolved). Match Prompt Sheet UI drains the queue on foreground (see HEALTHKIT.md § 13).

Queue API: `pendingMatches()`, `resolvePending(workoutId: UUID, snapshot: HealthKitWorkoutSnapshot, decision: MatchDecision)` where `MatchDecision` is `.link` / `.keepSeparate` / `.decideLater`.

- `.link` → apply link via `applyLink(workout:snapshot:)`; remove from queue.
- `.keepSeparate` → create a `WorkoutMatchRejection(healthKitUUID: snapshot.uuid, workoutId: workoutId, rejectedDate: .now)`; remove from queue.
- `.decideLater` → leave in queue; re-surface on next foreground.

## WorkoutMetricService (WorkoutMetricService.swift)

**Purpose:** Read-only aggregate query layer powering the Workout Detail Metric Detail Sheet (see SCREENS.md § Workout Detail → Metric Detail Sheet). Provides three operations: comparative average, 30-day sparkline data, and personal-best detection — all scoped to a single metric and Workout Type. Stateless. No model changes, no cascade impact.

### WorkoutMetric Enum

```swift
enum WorkoutMetric {
    case effort, duration, distance,
         avgHR, maxHR,
         activeKcal, totalKcal,
         elevation, exerciseMinutes
}
```

Callers pass the enum case rather than a field name string. Each case maps to a `KeyPath` on `Workout` internally; the service centralizes the field-extraction logic so views stay clean.

### Operations

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `comparativeAverage(for metric: WorkoutMetric, workoutType: String, context: ModelContext) → Double?` | Returns the all-time average of the metric across all logged `Workout` records of `workoutType` where the metric is non-nil. Returns nil when fewer than 3 such workouts exist (the data-sufficiency threshold — see SCREENS.md § Metric Detail Sheet → Empty States). |
| `sparklineData(for metric: WorkoutMetric, workoutType: String, days: Int = 30, context: ModelContext) → [(date: Date, value: Double)]` | Returns time-series data points for the metric across the last `days` days of same-`workoutType` workouts where the metric is non-nil. Sorted ascending by date. Empty array if fewer than 3 data points exist. |
| `isPersonalBest(for metric: WorkoutMetric, workout: Workout, context: ModelContext) → Bool` | Returns true when `workout`'s value for `metric` is the maximum across all in-scope same-`workoutType` workouts. Returns false for PR-ineligible metrics regardless of value (see § PR Eligibility below). Returns false when fewer than 2 workouts of that type have the metric set (need at least one comparison point). |

### PR Eligibility

| Metric | PR-Eligible? | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Distance | ✓ | Longer cardio session is a clear achievement |
| Active kcal | ✓ | More calories burned = more effort |
| Total kcal | ✓ | Same as Active |
| Elevation Ascended | ✓ | More climbing is a clear achievement |
| Effort | ✗ | High effort is not a goal |
| Avg HR / Max HR | ✗ | Higher HR is not a goal |
| Duration | ✗ | Longer is not always better; could distort across workout types |
| Exercise Minutes | ✗ | Correlated with Duration; same concern |

`isPersonalBest` returns false unconditionally for non-eligible metrics. Caller (the Metric Detail Sheet) never renders the Personal Best chip in those cases.

### Computation Rules

- **All-time scope:** comparative average and PR detection scan all logged `Workout` records of the matching type — no time-window filter (unlike sparkline which is bounded to 30 days).
- **Nil handling:** records where the metric value is nil are excluded entirely from averages, sparklines, and PR comparisons. Nil data does not pull averages down.
- **Same-type filter:** all queries filter by `workout.workoutType == workoutType` (exact match, case-sensitive — workout types are AppConstants enum-style strings).
- **Excludes the current workout from comparisons:** when computing comparative average for the workout being viewed, the current workout's own value is **not** included in the average. The detail sheet's "your typical session" comparison reads against everyone else of the same type, so the user sees how this session relates to their baseline.
- **Unit handling:** values are returned in storage units (kg, km, meters) — formatting/conversion happens in the view layer per `useLbs` / `useMiles` user settings.
- **Read-only:** no mutations, no cascades. Pure query service. Safe to call from any actor; SwiftData fetches are main-actor-bound by `ModelContext` convention.

### Cascade Impact

**None.** This service does not modify any data. The detail sheet re-queries on every open, so changes elsewhere (workout edits, deletes) are reflected automatically without invalidation logic.

### File Dependencies

## WorkoutTypeOrderService (WorkoutTypeOrderService.swift)

- **Create:** When a workout is saved and no WorkoutTypeOrder exists for that type → create with sortOrder = max + 1, isExpanded = false, activeSortOption = "newestFirst", activeFiltersJSON = nil.
- **Delete:** When last workout of a type is deleted → remove the WorkoutTypeOrder record.
- **Reorder:** Accept array of workoutType strings, re-index sortOrder starting from 0.
- **Toggle expand/collapse:** Flip isExpanded for a given type.
- **Update sort/filter:** Persist activeSortOption and activeFiltersJSON per type.

---

## WorkoutTemplateService (WorkoutTemplateService.swift)

- **Create:** Template + TemplateExerciseSets. workoutType restricted to Strength Training / HIIT.
- **Retrieve:** All templates sorted by dateCreated (newest first).
- **Update:** Name, duration, add/modify/delete TemplateExerciseSets.
- **Delete:** Cascade-delete all TemplateExerciseSets. No effect on other data.
- **Apply:** Return data snapshot (not a reference) for pre-populating Log Workout form.

---

## PlanService (PlanService.swift)

**Purpose:** CRUD for scheduled workouts, recurrence generation, date resolution, template snapshot encoding/decoding, and completion flow.

### Template Snapshot

When a user schedules a template, the exercise data (names, sets, reps, weights, sort order) is serialized into `ScheduledWorkout.templateSnapshot` as a JSON blob at scheduling time. This ensures:
- Editing a template after scheduling does not silently alter planned workouts.
- Deleting a template does not orphan scheduled workouts.
- The "Complete Planned Workout" flow always has exercise data to populate.

**encodeSnapshot(template: WorkoutTemplate) → Data:** Serializes the template's TemplateExerciseSets into a JSON array of `{ exerciseName, sets, reps, weightKg, sortOrder }` objects.

**decodeSnapshot(data: Data) → [SnapshotExercise]:** Deserializes the JSON blob back into an array of exercise structs for populating Log Workout or creating a Workout directly.

### Scheduling

- **Schedule:** Create a `ScheduledWorkout` record. Copy name, workoutType, durationMinutes from the selected template. Encode template exercises into `templateSnapshot`. Set status = "planned". `scheduledDate` must be today or in the future — past dates are rejected.
- **Schedule recurring:** Accept a recurrence rule ("weekly" / "biweekly") and generate individual `ScheduledWorkout` records for the next 12 weeks, each sharing the same `recurrenceGroupId` (a new UUID). Each instance gets its own `templateSnapshot` copied at creation time.
- **Regenerate recurrence:** When the user opens the Plan tab and fewer than 4 future instances remain for a `recurrenceGroupId`, auto-generate additional instances to maintain a 12-week lookahead. Silent background operation.

### Retrieval

- **Fetch for date range:** Return all `ScheduledWorkout` records within a given date range, sorted by `scheduledDate` then `scheduledTime`.
- **Fetch for date:** Return all records for a specific calendar day.
- **Fetch today's planned:** Return the first `ScheduledWorkout` for today with status "planned" (used by Today's Plan widget left column).
- **Fetch Plan surface for date range:** Unified fetch used by the Plan screen calendar dots and Day Detail Area. Returns a merged, date-sorted collection of:
  1. All `ScheduledWorkout` records in the range (all statuses).
  2. All `Workout` records in the range **where** no `ScheduledWorkout` has `completedWorkoutId == workout.id` AND `workout.hiddenFromPlan == false`.
  
  The filter on condition (1) prevents duplicate representation of completed scheduled workouts (once as their `ScheduledWorkout`, once as the linked `Workout`). Callers distinguish the two record types and render logged-only cards vs. scheduled cards accordingly (see SCREENS.md § Plan → Day Detail Area).
- **Fetch Plan surface for date:** Same logic scoped to a single calendar day. Used by Day Detail Area and by the Today's Plan widget calendar square (for green dot presence on today).

### Completion

- **Complete:** Accept a `ScheduledWorkout`, RPE (optional), and duration (optional). Decode `templateSnapshot`, create a `Workout` + `ExerciseSet` records from the snapshot data plus RPE and duration. Set `ScheduledWorkout.status` = "completed" and `completedWorkoutId` = new Workout's ID. Trigger all standard workout-save cascades (PR recalc, goal auto-update, Training Load, streak, Power Level).
- **Complete via Log Workout:** When the user taps "Modify Exercises," pass the `ScheduledWorkout.id` through to Log Workout. On workout save, call back to PlanService to mark the slot completed and link the workout ID.

### Date Resolution

Determine the appropriate workout date when completing a planned workout:

- **Scheduled date is today:** Return today. No prompt needed.
- **Scheduled date is in the past:** Return both the scheduled date and today as options. Caller presents prompt to user.
- **Scheduled date is in the future:** Return today as the only valid date. Caller presents prompt. Post-dating is prohibited.

### Skip / Restore

- **Skip:** Set status = "skipped". No `Workout` record created. Reversible.
- **Restore:** Set status back to "planned" (from "skipped" only).

### Remove from Plan

The unified "Remove from Plan" action supports all non-planned card types on the Plan screen (planned and skipped `ScheduledWorkout`s, completed `ScheduledWorkout`s, and logged-only `Workout`s). Behavior varies by underlying record type:

- **Planned or skipped `ScheduledWorkout` (single):** Delete the `ScheduledWorkout` record. Standard delete confirmation required by caller.
- **Planned or skipped `ScheduledWorkout` (recurring):** Caller presents "This workout only / This and future workouts" prompt first. "This workout only" deletes this instance. "This and future" deletes this instance and all future instances sharing the same `recurrenceGroupId` with `scheduledDate` ≥ this instance's date. Past completed/skipped instances are never deleted.
- **Completed `ScheduledWorkout` (single) — dual-action:** Execute atomically:
  1. Delete the `ScheduledWorkout` record.
  2. Set `workout.hiddenFromPlan = true` on the linked `Workout` (resolved via `completedWorkoutId`).
  
  Without step 2, the dedup rule in § Retrieval → Fetch Plan surface would immediately re-surface the `Workout` as a logged-only card. The underlying `Workout` record is fully preserved in the Workouts screen and in all cascades — only its visibility on Plan is removed.
- **Completed `ScheduledWorkout` (recurring):** Caller presents "This workout only / This and future workouts" prompt. "This workout only" executes the dual-action on this instance. "This and future" executes the dual-action on this instance, plus deletes all future **planned** instances in the same `recurrenceGroupId` (existing recurring delete rule — past completed/skipped untouched).
- **Logged-only `Workout`:** Set `workout.hiddenFromPlan = true`. No `ScheduledWorkout` involved.

**Undo:** All variants emit a "Removed from Plan. [Undo]" toast (~4s auto-dismiss). Undo reverses the action:
- For logged-only and completed-scheduled variants, undo sets `workout.hiddenFromPlan = false`. The card reappears as a **logged-only card** (the deleted `ScheduledWorkout` record is not restored — this is acceptable behavior consistent with the dual-action's lineage-destroying semantics).
- For planned/skipped variants, undo restores the deleted `ScheduledWorkout` record from the pre-delete snapshot held in memory for the toast's lifetime. If the toast auto-dismisses before the user taps Undo, the deletion is permanent.

### Delete (legacy — now subsumed by Remove from Plan)

Historical note: the action previously named "Delete from Schedule" has been renamed to "Remove from Plan" and unified across all card types. Callers that previously invoked a plain `delete(scheduledWorkout:)` now invoke `removeFromPlan(card:)` with the card's underlying record. The SwiftData operations are unchanged for planned/skipped cases — only naming and the addition of the completed-card dual-action branch.

### Workout Deletion Linkage

When a `Workout` that is linked to a `ScheduledWorkout` (via `completedWorkoutId`) is deleted, PlanService sets `completedWorkoutId` to nil and reverts status to "planned". This allows the user to re-complete the scheduled slot.

## HomeWidgetService (HomeWidgetService.swift)

- **Seed defaults:** On first launch (hasSeededDefaultWidgets = false), create HomeWidget records for Training Load, Workout Info, Week Streak in that order. Set hasSeededDefaultWidgets = true.
- **Add:** Create HomeWidget at max sortOrder + 1. No duplicate widgetType allowed.
- **Delete:** Remove HomeWidget record. Re-index remaining sortOrder.

---

## TrendsChartService (TrendsChartService.swift)

Mirrors `HomeWidgetService` for the Trends screen.

- **Seed defaults:** On first launch (hasSeededDefaultTrendsCharts = false), create TrendsChart records for Strength Tracker, Training Frequency, Personal Records, Training Load Trend in that order. Set hasSeededDefaultTrendsCharts = true.
- **Add:** Create TrendsChart at max sortOrder + 1. No duplicate chartType allowed.
- **Delete:** Remove TrendsChart record. Re-index remaining sortOrder. No underlying workout data affected.
- **Reorder:** Accept array of chartType strings, re-index sortOrder starting from 0.

---

## ExerciseSuggestionService (ExerciseSuggestionService.swift)

**Purpose:** Hybrid autocomplete for exercise name inputs across Log Workout, Create Template, and Add Goal (Custom exercise).

### Data Sources
1. **User history:** Exercise names from all previously logged workouts. Refreshed after workout save/delete.
2. **Static dictionary:** Curated list in AppConstants (see `CONSTANTS.md`).
3. **Alias map:** Abbreviations → canonical names (see `CONSTANTS.md`).

### Suggestion Ranking (highest to lowest priority)
1. **Prefix match** from user history (e.g., "Ben" → "Bench Press" from history)
2. **Prefix match** from dictionary (e.g., "Ben" → "Bench Press" from dictionary)
3. **Word-boundary match** from user history (e.g., "Press" → "Bench Press")
4. **Word-boundary match** from dictionary
5. **Contains match** from user history (e.g., "bell" → "Barbell Rows")
6. **Contains match** from dictionary
7. **Alias resolution:** If input matches an alias key (case-insensitive), include the canonical name as a suggestion.

### Closest-Match Nudge
If no candidates match via prefix/word-boundary/contains, check Levenshtein edit distance. Surface the closest match within edit distance ≤ 2 as the top suggestion (e.g., "Bech Press" → "Bench Press"). No special visual distinction. Edit distance 3+ → no nudge.

### Rules
- Maximum 5 suggestions returned
- Empty or whitespace-only query → empty list
- Deduplication: case-insensitive. If same exercise exists in history + dictionary, history version wins.
- All matching is case-insensitive
- `refreshHistory()` updates the history source after workout save/delete

### FortiFitExerciseAutocomplete Component
Dropdown overlay below input. Elevated surface (#2d2d2d), border (#404040). Each row: 44pt min height, 13px 600-weight #e5e5e5 text. First row highlighted (#3b82f6 at 10% opacity). Appears when ≥1 character typed and suggestions exist. Tap suggestion → populates input, dismisses immediately. Tap outside / press return / lose focus → dismisses, accepts typed text. Renders above sibling cards via zIndex. 0.15s opacity fade-in. Identical behavior across Log Workout, Create Template, and Add Goal.

---

## GoalSnapshotService (GoalSnapshotService.swift)

**Purpose:** Manages `GoalSnapshot` records that power the 30-day sparkline on goal cards. Captures **per-workout session values** anchored to each matching workout's `date`, so the sparkline reflects what the user actually did on each training day — including regressions, light sessions, and time between PRs — not just PR events.

### Snapshot Model
The sparkline and the ring are two different lenses on the same goal:
- **Ring** reflects the all-time best within scope (`currentValueKg`, `currentReps`, or `currentDistanceKm` / `currentDurationMinutes`) — unchanged from existing behavior.
- **Sparkline** reflects per-workout performance: each matching workout produces a snapshot anchored to its `workout.date`, using that workout's best-of-day session value. Multiple matching workouts on the same date collapse to a single snapshot with the best-of-day value.

### Snapshot Triggers
Snapshots are computed/recomputed whenever matching workout data changes:
- After workout log → snapshot appended/updated on `workout.date` for each affected goal.
- After workout edit → snapshot recomputed on the workout's `date`. If the edit changed `date`, both old-date and new-date snapshots recompute.
- After workout deletion → snapshot on the deleted workout's `date` recomputes from remaining matching in-scope workouts on that date. If no remaining in-scope workouts on that date, the snapshot is deleted.
- After workout type deletion → bulk recompute across all affected dates per the per-workout rules above.
- After goal definition edit (Add/Edit Goal) → if `resetDate` was cleared, previously out-of-scope workouts may now qualify; rebuild snapshots for affected dates from in-scope workouts. GoalSnapshotService exposes a `rebuildSnapshots(goal:)` operation for this path.
- **Not on `lastCelebratedDate` change or ring display changes alone** — only on actual underlying workout or scope changes.

Weekly Workouts is a special case: its value is a runtime count, so a snapshot is written on any day a matching workout is logged (today), with `value` = current week's workout count at end-of-day. Its existing behavior is unchanged.

### Per-Workout Value Computation (best-of-day)
For a given goal and calendar date, the snapshot `value` is computed from all **in-scope, matching** workouts on that date (per § Reset Scoping). "Best-of-day" applies the same per-goal-type arithmetic as the ring's "best-ever within scope" logic (see § Goal Auto-Update), but scoped to a single date rather than the full goal history:

| Goal Type | Best-of-day input | Snapshot `value` |
|---|---|---|
| exercisePR (Strength PR) | Top `weightKg` across matching ExerciseSets on that date (name match, case-insensitive) | That weight in kg. No matching sets → no snapshot written (or existing one deleted on recompute). |
| repsPR (Repetitions PR) | Highest `reps` across matching ExerciseSets on that date | That rep count as `Double`. Same no-match behavior as exercisePR. |
| speedDistance — distance-only | Highest `distanceKm` across matching-type workouts on that date | Distance progress % (`distanceKm / targetDistanceKm × 100`, clamped 0–100). |
| speedDistance — duration-only (endurance) | Highest `durationMinutes` across matching-type workouts on that date | Duration progress % (`durationMinutes / targetDurationMinutes × 100`, clamped 0–100). |
| speedDistance — speed target (both set) | Per-workout `overallProgress %` per § Goal Progress Calculation; take the highest. Ties broken by most recent workout. | That `overallProgress %`. |
| weeklyWorkouts | Runtime count (special case — see below) | `Double(current workout count this week)` at end of day. |

### Rules
- **One snapshot per goal per day:** Deduplicates by `goalId` + calendar date (time component zeroed). Best-of-day computation applies when multiple matching workouts exist on the same date.
- **No backfilling for brand-new goals:** Snapshots are only computed for dates on which a matching in-scope workout exists. There is no historical scan at goal creation. The sparkline carries forward the last known value for days with no snapshot.
- **No automatic pruning:** Snapshots persist for the lifetime of the goal. Snapshots are deleted only by: (a) goal deletion cascade, (b) Reset Goal Progress (wipes all), or (c) workout-change cascade that removes the last supporting in-scope workout on a given date.
- **Out-of-scope filtering:** All per-workout computations ignore workouts where `workout.date <= goal.resetDate` AND `workout.lastModifiedDate <= goal.resetDate` (per § Reset Scoping). A snapshot is not written for dates that have no in-scope matching workout.
- **Migration:** Existing GoalSnapshot records written under the prior PR-event model are left alone. They will be gradually superseded as new snapshots are written and as edit/delete cascades recompute dates; there is no one-time historical rebuild at update. Old and new snapshots coexist on the sparkline during the transition.

### Responsibilities
- **recomputeSnapshot(goal, date, context):** Computes and writes (or deletes) the snapshot for a given goal and date based on currently stored in-scope matching workouts. Called from goal auto-update, workout delete/edit cascades. Idempotent.
- **recomputeSnapshotsForWorkout(workout, affectedGoals, context):** For each affected goal, recomputes the snapshot on `workout.date`. If the caller also supplies a prior date (on edit with date change), recomputes that too.
- **rebuildSnapshots(goal, context):** Drops all existing snapshots for this goal and rebuilds from all in-scope matching workouts. Called on goal definition edit when `resetDate` clears.
- **fetchSnapshots(goalId, days: 30, context) → [GoalSnapshot]:** Returns snapshots for the given goal within the last N days, sorted by date ascending.
- **deleteSnapshots(goalId, context):** Removes all snapshots for a given goal. Called on goal deletion cascade and on Reset Goal Progress.

## WorkoutShareService (WorkoutShareService.swift)

**Purpose:** Renders a single workout as a styled PNG image card and presents the iOS share sheet from the Workout Detail screen. See `SCREENS.md` § Workout Detail (Share Image Card) for full card layout, styling, and edge cases.

### Responsibilities

- **renderShareImage(workout: Workout, userSettings: UserSettings) → UIImage:** Builds a `WorkoutShareCardView` (a pure SwiftUI view not displayed on screen), renders it via `ImageRenderer` at @3x scale. Respects `useLbs` and `useMiles` from UserSettings for unit display. Returns the rendered `UIImage`.
- **presentShareSheet(image: UIImage):** Presents `UIActivityViewController` via a `UIViewControllerRepresentable` wrapper. Activity items: `[UIImage]`. No excluded activity types (allow all system share targets).

### Rendering Rules

- Uses the same color tokens and typography from `Theme/` — no hardcoded values.
- Weight display: `weightKg` converted via `UnitConversion` if `useLbs == true`.
- Distance display: `distanceKm` converted via `UnitConversion` if `useMiles == true`.
- Exercise list capped at 10. If workout has more than 10, show first 10 followed by muted "+X more exercises" line.
- Date/time format follows device locale (matches Workout Detail screen behavior). When `workout.time` is nil, omit time component.
- Summary pills with nil values omitted entirely.
- Session notes excluded from the image.

### Error Handling

If `ImageRenderer` returns nil (render failure), show a brief toast: "Couldn't generate image. Try again." (auto-dismiss ~2s, matching existing toast pattern). Do not present the share sheet.

## TemplateShareService (TemplateShareService.swift)

**Purpose:** Encodes workout templates into QR code URLs, generates QR code images, decodes incoming QR URLs, and handles template import with duplicate name resolution. See `SCREENS.md` § Saved Templates List (Share Template QR Modal) and `SCREENS.md` § Template Import Prompt for UI specs.

### URL Scheme

```
fitnavi://template?v=1&data=<base64-encoded-JSON>
```

- **Scheme:** `fitnavi` — registered in Info.plist as a custom URL type.
- **Host:** `template` — identifies the payload type for future extensibility.
- **v:** Payload version (integer). Current version: `1`. Used for forward compatibility — if the payload format changes, the decoder can handle or reject older/newer versions.
- **data:** Base64url-encoded JSON string containing the full template data.

### Payload Format (v1)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "name": "Push Day",
  "workoutType": "Strength Training",
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "exercises": [
    {
      "exerciseName": "Bench Press",
      "sets": 4,
      "reps": 8,
      "weightKg": 84.0,
      "sortOrder": 0
    },
    {
      "exerciseName": "Push-Ups",
      "sets": 3,
      "reps": 15,
      "weightKg": null,
      "sortOrder": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

- `durationMinutes`: null when not set.
- `weightKg`: null for bodyweight exercises.
- `workoutType`: Must be "Strength Training" or "HIIT". Any other value is treated as malformed.
- Exercises ordered by `sortOrder`.

### Responsibilities

- **encodeTemplate(template: WorkoutTemplate) → URL:** Serializes the template and its TemplateExerciseSets into the v1 JSON payload, base64url-encodes it, and constructs the `fitnavi://` URL.
- **generateQRCode(from url: URL) → UIImage?:** Uses Core Image `CIQRCodeGenerator` to produce a QR code image from the URL string. Returns nil on failure. Native framework — no third-party dependency.
- **decodeTemplateURL(url: URL) → TemplatePayload?:** Parses the incoming URL, extracts the `data` parameter, base64url-decodes it, deserializes the JSON into a `TemplatePayload` struct. Returns nil if any step fails (malformed URL, invalid base64, JSON parse error, missing required fields, invalid workoutType).
- **importTemplate(payload: TemplatePayload, context: ModelContext) → WorkoutTemplate:** Creates a new WorkoutTemplate + TemplateExerciseSets in SwiftData from the decoded payload. Calls `resolveTemplateName` to handle duplicates before saving.
- **resolveTemplateName(name: String, context: ModelContext) → String:** Checks if a template with the given name exists. If not, returns the name as-is. If so, appends " (1)", " (2)", etc., incrementing until a unique name is found.

### QR Code Generation Rules

- Uses `CIQRCodeGenerator` from Core Image (native, no third-party).
- Error correction level: `M` (medium — 15% recovery, good balance of data density and damage tolerance).
- Output scaled to ~250pt for comfortable scanning from a phone screen.
- QR image rendered as white modules on transparent background, displayed on Card Surface (#1a1a1a) in the modal.

### QR Code Size Limits

QR codes (version 40, error correction M) can hold ~2,331 bytes in binary mode. A template with 10 exercises and typical field lengths encodes to approximately 500–800 bytes after base64, well within limits. Templates with 20+ exercises or very long names may approach the limit. If the encoded URL exceeds 2,331 bytes, show a toast: "Template is too large to share via QR code." (~2s auto-dismiss). Do not generate the QR code.

### Deep Link Handling

The app must register `fitnavi` as a custom URL scheme in Info.plist. In `FortiFitApp.swift`, handle incoming URLs via `.onOpenURL { url in ... }`. When a `fitnavi://template` URL is received:

1. Call `decodeTemplateURL(url:)`.
2. If decoding succeeds → present the Template Import Prompt (see `SCREENS.md` § Template Import Prompt).
3. If decoding fails → present the error modal with "This QR code couldn't be read." message.
